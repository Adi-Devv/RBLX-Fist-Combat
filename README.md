Simple Roblox combat with R6/R15 avatar types.
For this Package to work you need to do the following
#1 Create a Local Script in StarterGUI and Paste the contents of "ClientMain" into it
#2 Create a Remote as a child of the Local Script we created above, You can name the remote anything but you will have to change the name insides the script to match it.
#3 Create a Server Script as a child of the Local Script we made first. Paste the contents of "ServerMain" into it.
#4 Create a folder called Animations and make it a child of the Server Script we made above.
  #4a Create six Animation Objects inside of the Folder 5 will be named Punch1-5 (Example: Punch1, Punch2 and so on) then make an animation called Block.
#6 Create a folder called Hitboxes and make it a child of the Server Script we made at step #3.
  #6a Make a part instance called whatever you want default variable is set to "PunchHitbox" so if you want something else you will have to go inside of the script in change
  it.
    #6ac Make sure the part is Anchored and has CanCollide set to true.
